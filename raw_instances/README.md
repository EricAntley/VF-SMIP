# VF-SMIP-
Repository for my SMIP instances.

These files are c-code headers that contain a function called 'reserve_instance' which loads the data associated with the specific instance by modifying a
number of passed pointers, and allocating arrays for objective vectors, constraint matrices, probabilities, and scenarios.
